Professional ticketing application for a company. It allows the resolution of incidents or breakdowns between a customer service and a technical support department. It was developed using CodeIgniter PHP framework and JavaScript.

The customer service department will create tickets that will appear in a list from which SAT can assign and process or resolve them. It also includes other options for managing a business such as inventory, logistics, schedules, supervision, etc. and general options such as user management, account, profile, etc.

It allows for the automatic sending of incidents alerts via email (need a mail server) or Telegram (API). Extras: PDF through FPDF and Excel with PHPExcel generation.
